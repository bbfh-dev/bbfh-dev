## My qualities

- I am the CEO of Unfinished Projects Inc.
- I don't need AI to make slop.
- The only Clean code I know is the one that hasn't been written.
- Over 7 years of experience in non-commercial slop coding (the best kind of slop coding).
- I'm a fish but live above the C level.

## What slop do I make

- **Graphical design** — Design websites, icons, logotypes, and art pieces.
- **Websites** — You can call me a full-stack engineer. Although the whole web is slop.
- **Minecraft projects** — Create Minecraft adventure maps, data & resource packs.
- **Tools** — Create tools & scripts for other developers to use (Go, Bash, Tree-sitter).
- **Other personal projects** — Projects I haven't published/finished in Java, Python, C, and other languages.
