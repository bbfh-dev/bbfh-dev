## Hi, I'm BubbleFish

I am the CEO of Unfinished Projects Inc. Extremely passionate about software engineering, if I get an idea, I make it happen (thus the number of projects I've created).

## My qualities

- I don't need AI to make slop ‚ú®
- The only Clean code I know is the one that hasn't been written. üó£Ô∏è
- Over 7 years of experience in non-comertial slop coding (the best kind of slop coding). üìà
- I'm a fish but live above the C level. ü•∂
